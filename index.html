<p class="title">&nbsp; &nbsp;Dear President Jim Yong Kim,</p>
	<center>
	<p class="paragraph">It’s a pleasure to be writing to you today, President Jim Yong Kim. My name is Daniel Lloyd Hawke and I am an 8th grade student at the International School of Manila. I have spent the last four to five weeks researching poverty and its relationship with modern slavery. This has been brought to my attention throughout the things I see everyday in this country. I believe that what I’ve learnt must be shared and solved with care. Now that I’ve introduced myself, let’s discuss the whys and hows of affiliation between poverty and slavery.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">Poverty and Slavery. Two very different issues that are interconnected by their causes. No matter how many times the problem of poverty and slavery is addressed, the issue still remains at large. Some causes for slavery include the unequal statuses that women have and being vulnerable in poverty (Stroede). Vulnerability is the dominating factor connecting slavery with poverty. Poverty has women and children out in the open, whether to be kidnapped, raped, or kept as a slave. This is why I am writing this letter, because there is an available scenario to kill two birds with one stone. The roots of slavery is poverty, therefore a solution to slavery eliminate the two major problems. The eyes of disbelievers must be opened, and they should realize that an effort should be put into finding the slaveowners who promote this horrendous practice. This letter will focus on the concerns of how poverty impacts women and children’s ability to avoid slavery.

	<center><p class="paragraph"> The best way to solve poverty-caused slavery is to educate, feed and give (healthcare, shelter, safety) to the vulnerable people in poverty to avoid vulnerability to slavery in poverty. This will be achieved with the EASY (Educate, Act/Aid, Save and Yield) Program. The EASY Program will focus on main causes of poverty and ease the struggle of poverty and slavery by educating, acting/aiding, saving and yielding. The E in EASY stands for educate, which UNICEF has said is the strongest key to protect children from poverty because more than 100 million children have been lifted with education  (“Goal: Eradicate Extreme”). 

  </p>
  <p class="paragraph"> UNICEF also provides health care, clean water, education, immunizations and other services. The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1990 (“United Nations Millennium”). According to the data provided if the EASY Program provides education services, health services, feeding programs and rescue teams to those vulnerable in poverty, it will benefit them. Also, jobs that need no experience will be offered to unemployed people in the countries with the program. There has only been a good outcome seen in Ghana from all of Africa with the school feeding program which is now seen in 4,700 schools all over Ghana (“Ending Poverty in”). A solution only working in one country of all the 54 countries in Africa enforced by the World Bank. This is a failed solution because the feeding programs only worked in 1 of 54 countries in Africa and was based in schools, which is not the only place that is most useful. The EASY Program will avoid this by not establishing the feeding stations in schools, but in poverty strong areas of underdeveloped countries.</p>
  <p class="paragraph">People argue about how poverty is more important than slavery, however this is immensely incorrect. Throughout the world right now, there are 20 to 30 million slaves (“Modern Day Slavery”). Statistics like this anger people against slavery, but still slavery isn’t seen everywhere. It is hidden, poverty is in the open and thus providing people with the conclusion that poverty is more important. You are more likely to be hit by lightning than going to jail for owning a slave (“Modern Day Slavery”). When the chance of that occurring is revealed, it details on why slavery isn’t seen everywhere. Slave owners hide their slaves, and get away with it. Poverty and slavery aren’t polar opposites or inconsistent with each other, they are balanced issues. The focus on these issues must be equal, EASY will avoid the misconceptions.

<h3>Inspirations for the EASY Program Solution:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.thefreedomproject.org" target="_blank"/>The Freedom Project</a> <h4>THE FREEDOM PROJECT EXISTS TO END CHILD HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND SLAVERY</h4>

  </li>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="paragraph">Now, it is time for action, not addressing or spreading awareness, but it is time for the A in EASY, Act/Aim. The EASY Program is required to be situated in the poverty active areas of Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Niger, Malawi, South Asia, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. In Latin America & Caribbean there are 70.5 million people in poverty and 320.6 million people in poverty in East Asia & the pacific as of 2013. South Asia has 854.1 million people in poverty and Sub-Saharan Africa has 616.3 million people in poverty as of 2013 (“Poverty and Equity Database”). The freedom project consists in four different countries, Thailand, Burma, Philippines and India (“What We Do”). As of this project, everyday children have been kept from trafficking and slavery (“ABOUT US”).</p>
<p class="paragraph">The EASY Program will expand off of the freedom project and will work in many more countries. Clearly, South Asia & Sub-Saharan Africa have a greater population in poverty, verifying that the EASY Program should be positioned there. This must be proposed in meetings like the Annual Meeting of IMF and The World Bank Group. The World Bank need to fund and construct all structures, advisors and concepts mentioned in the EASY Program.

<p class="paragraph">United Nations states that poverty is causing $150 billion a year to be earned from modern slavery, trafficking and forced labor (Besheer). With all the research only an idiot wouldn’t see that extreme poverty is what makes people vulnerable to slavery, not the other way around. Now, the solution is clear, if you end or decrease extreme poverty then slavery will trail with it (Marinelli). To summarize, for the EASY Program to triumph, education services, healthcare services, rescue teams and feeding stations must prevail. This Program is especially concerned for women and children, thus they must be targeted first.
</p>
<p class="paragraph">No matter the commitment and desire in seeing children and women thrive out of poverty and slavery, it won’t be enough to cover the costs. That’s why this is directed towards you, the President of the World Bank, if you believe in the EASY Program then the countries will too. Working together will fulfill the financial need to have this program succeed. With this program introduced and the World Bank working with it step by step, the world will truly believe they still have a chance. A chance that the promise of equality is to be granted to the innocent people left desperate.

 </p>
<p class="paragraph">I would like to thank you for spending your time reading this letter. I dearly have faith in you considering this as a step to take to abolish the problem of poverty and slavery. May the eradication of slavery and poverty transpire flourishingly.

<h5>SOLUTION RATIONALE PARAGRAPH:</h5>
<p class="paragraph">The best way to solve poverty-caused slavery is to educate, feed and give (healthcare, shelter, safety) to the vulnerable people in poverty with the EASY (Educate, Act/Aid, Save & Yield) Program. The EASY Program will benefit all vulnerable people in slavery and poverty because the program will educate, act/aid, save and yield to those that need it the most. UNICEF also provides health care, clean water, education, immunizations and other services. The target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half was met five years ahead of the 2015 deadline. More than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since 1990 (“United Nations Millennium”). This evidence proves that educating, providing health care and rescue teams is the most desirable and most advantageous way to decrease the population of victims of poverty and slavery. </p>
<p class="paragraph">The World Bank attempted to heal poverty and hunger around Africa with feeding programs, but only provided a nutritious meal for children in Ghana. There has only been a good outcome seen in Ghana from all of Africa with the school feeding program which is now seen in 4,700 schools all over Ghana. This gives the 1,700,000 students/children a lunch fulfilling all their nutritious needs (“Ending Poverty in”). This evidence signifies the importance of expanding a program to affect as many people as possible. The EASY Program will provide health services, education, feeding programs and rescue teams to the defenseless sufferers of slavery and poverty. It will follow the successful education given by UNICEF, and improve the feeding programs from the World Bank. President Jim Yong Kim, you must fund this program, propose it and enforce it throughout meetings and with members of the World Bank Group.
